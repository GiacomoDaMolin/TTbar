Correction NUM_GlobalMuons_DEN_genTracks has 4 inputs
   Input year (string): year/scenario: example 2016preVFP, 2017 etc
   Input abseta (real): Probe abseta
   Input pt (real): Probe pt
   Input ValType (string): sf or syst (currently 'sf' is nominal, and 'systup' and 'systdown' are up/down variations with total stat+syst uncertainties. Individual systs are also available (in these cases syst only, not sf +/- syst)
